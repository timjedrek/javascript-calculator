Changes/Progress/Comments/Notes
- 12-26-2021 Tim Santos create index.html, style.css, app.js files
- 12-27-2021 Tim Santos created consts for each button, created function to update screen with each button press and also store that value in a variable.  Working on creating logic for plus button click first.  My logic is that as we enter values into the calculator, the expression will end up like this: 1234 "some type of operator" 789 so for example, "123 + 456".  There are three parts to this expression.  
    - "123" is "number1"
    - " + " is the "operator"
    - "456" is "number2"
If the expression gets to two numbers, then on click of either the equals "ni" button or on click of any of the operators wou;d trigger an eval type function, and print out "579"
570 would become number1 with number2 going back to nothing and what ever else gets typed afterwards. 
Also, this is for later on, but let's say I clicked plus sign.  then clicked subtract sign, well then the "operator" needs to change along with the display..
anyways.. kinda got the addition thing to work.  Also, for some reason CSS hover is not working.
